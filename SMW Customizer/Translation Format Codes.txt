Here are some codes to do some formating:

<br> - Force a line-break
<hr> - Horizontal Line (forces a line-break)
<span id="b">[yourtext]</span> - Bold Text.
<span id="i">[yourtext]</span> - Oblique Text.
<span id="bi">[yourtext]</span> - Bold and Oblique Text.
<mark>[yourtext]</mark> - Marks some important stuff.

Note to Translators:
DO NOT ADD YOUR OWN STYLES TO THIS!
I WON'T UPDATE THE STYLE JUST BECAUSE YOU WANT TO HAVE SOMETHING SPECIAL!
